6月份从杭州跳槽来到南京，转眼竟已经半年了。虽然过去常来旅游，但还是第一次生活在这里这么久。

以前偏爱南京 ，尤其是大学的时候。一是距离相当近，不费什么周章；二来学生时期小布尔乔亚文青病发作得最厉害，很喜欢南京的历史底蕴与人文余温 。来了许多次之后愈发的喜欢，一直将其视为理想的工作和居住城市。但是好死不死实习工作和毕业签的第一份工作都错过了南京。

22年在杭州实习了半年，对杭州的初印象是繁荣和新生。这座城市从G20峰会之后开始快速发展，整个城市面貌都是焕然一新、欣欣向荣的。

我常和好友互相打趣，你若是没钱，杭州只是杭州，你若是有钱，杭州才是真正的杭州。也算是对我们微薄实习工资的自嘲。

离开杭州不到两年就又回去了，果真是缘分未尽吧。这一次在那里工作生活了一年还多，但心境却完全不同了。

实习的时候，有多个好友在身边，整天嬉笑怒骂虽然收入堪忧但是相当幸福。而这次是我独自勇闯杭州，刚去的时候落魄到住在青旅，这么长时间也没交到什么交心的朋友，个人生活被工作时间侵占挤压，甚至还谈了一段刻骨铭心但不到四个月就无疾而终的恋爱，使我备受打击。

这一次杭州给我的印象是繁华、开放、包容，但多了点孤独，少了点人情。杭州是不排斥新事物的产生和发展的，他容许不同思想、文化自由地碰撞、融合，不断让自己新生。代价是钢铁的森林、汹涌的车流和慢不下来的人流，我没有办法停下来去好好感受我的人生。

于是我决定离开那里。

来到南京后的这半年，日子过得慢了许多。

没有了杭州那种仿佛要把每分每秒都变现的焦灼感，我终于能慢腾腾地在梧桐树影下走一走。我开始习惯在周末去逛那些早就在地图上收藏好的书店，或者只是在玄武湖边漫无目的地吹吹风。

虽然偶尔也会想起杭州。想起在西湖边漫步的傍晚，想起龙井路层层叠叠的绿，想起曾与我交集的形形色色的人，还有那座城市永远透着的一股不服输的生命力。其实我怀念的或许不是那里的生活，而是实习时那段即便窘迫却有人并肩作战的岁月，和那个初出茅庐、对未来满是憧憬的自己。只是那种热闹和新鲜感，终究在后来那一年的孤独和疲惫中被消磨掉了。

如今，曾经理想的城市真正住进来，滤镜也随之碎了一地，露出它接地气、甚至琐碎的一面，不再仅仅是大学记忆里那个笼罩着人文光环的滤镜。但我并不失望，在这里，我起码能找回一点生活的主权。那些曾经被工作和孤独挤压掉的自我，正一点点在烟火气和秦淮河的晚风里缝补回来。

我不知道自己会在南京待多久，也不敢确信这里就是终点。但起码此刻，我不再是被车流裹挟的零件，而是一个可以随时停下来，看一片叶子落下的路人。


[EN_START]

It has been six months since I left Hangzhou for a new job in Nanjing. Despite my frequent visits as a tourist in the past, this is the first time I have truly lived here for such an extended period.

I have always had a soft spot for Nanjing, especially back in my university days. For one, it was conveniently close, requiring little effort to visit. Secondly, during that peak phase of my "bourgeois intellectual" sensibilities, I was deeply drawn to the city's historical depth and its lingering cultural warmth. After many visits, my affection only grew, and I began to see it as the ideal place to work and settle down. Yet, as fate would have it—or perhaps just bad luck—I missed out on Nanjing for both my internship and my first job after graduation.

In 2022, I interned in Hangzhou for six months. My initial impression was one of prosperity and rebirth. Following the G20 summit, the city had entered a phase of rapid development; its entire facade was fresh, vibrant, and thriving. My friends and I used to joke: "If you're broke, Hangzhou is just Hangzhou; but if you're wealthy, Hangzhou becomes the real Hangzhou." It was a self-deprecating nod to our meager internship stipends.

Less than two years after leaving, I found myself back in Hangzhou—a lingering fate, perhaps. This time, I stayed for over a year, but my state of mind had shifted entirely.

During my internship, I was surrounded by friends. We spent our days laughing and bickering, and despite our financial woes, we were genuinely happy. This time, however, I was venturing into Hangzhou alone. I started off in the humble setting of a youth hostel. Over the year, I failed to make any soul-deep connections, and my personal life was relentlessly squeezed by work hours. I even went through a poignant romance that ended abruptly after less than four months, leaving me devastated.

This second encounter left me with an impression of Hangzhou as a place of grandeur, openness, and inclusion—yet one that felt lonelier and lacked a human touch. Hangzhou does not shy away from the birth and evolution of new things; it allows different ideas and cultures to collide and merge, constantly reinventing itself. The price, however, is a forest of steel, surging traffic, and a restless crowd that never slows down. I found it impossible to pause and truly experience my own life.

So, I decided to leave.

Life has slowed down significantly during these past six months in Nanjing.

The frantic urgency I felt in Hangzhou—the sense that every second had to be monetized—is gone. Finally, I can take a slow stroll under the shadows of the plane trees. I’ve started a routine of visiting bookstores I had long ago bookmarked on my map, or simply feeling the breeze by Xuanwu Lake with no particular destination in mind.

Of course, I still think of Hangzhou occasionally. I remember the evenings wandering by West Lake, the cascading layers of green along Longjing Road, the diverse people who crossed my path, and that unyielding vitality the city always radiates. Perhaps what I miss isn't the life there itself, but that period during my internship when, despite the hardship, I had people by my side—and that version of myself, fresh out of school and brimming with hope. Sadly, that sense of excitement and novelty was eventually eroded by the loneliness and exhaustion of this past year.

Now that I am living in what was once my "ideal city," the filters have fallen away, revealing its down-to-earth and even mundane side. It is no longer just the place enveloped in the cultural halo of my college memories. But I am not disappointed. Here, I have at least reclaimed some sovereignty over my life. The pieces of myself that were once crushed by work and solitude are being stitched back together, bit by bit, amidst the everyday bustle and the evening breeze of the Qinhuai River.

I don’t know how long I will stay in Nanjing, nor can I say for sure if this is my final destination. But at least for now, I am no longer a mere cog swept along by the current of traffic. I am a passerby who can stop at any moment to watch a single leaf fall.

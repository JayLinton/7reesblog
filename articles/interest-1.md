南京这几天的阴雨，总让人觉得骨子里透着一层冷意，走在中山路上，满目都是梧桐树凋零后的枯索。铅灰色的云低低地压在半空，这种天气总让我想起阿尔及尔那场刺眼的、粘稠的、最终酿成命案的阳光。

刚读完加缪的《局外人》，这种感觉很奇特————书并不厚，却像是一块被磨得极其尖锐的冰，不声不响地刺穿了日常生活中那些温热的假象。

关于这部作品，最广为人知的标签莫过于“荒诞”。但我合上书，脑子里挥之不去的却是一个词：生理性真实。

人们习惯于把默尔索解读为一个对抗世俗的英雄，但我更愿意把他看作一个拒绝进化的、极度诚实的“感官动物”。

他并不是故意要在母亲的葬礼上表现得冷漠。对他而言，漫长的守灵、刺眼的阳光、脚下发烫的柏油路，这些生理上的不适感远比“丧母之痛”这种抽象的情绪要真实得多。他不去表演悲伤，是因为他当时的身体确实只感受到了疲惫。

这其实是一件很冒犯人的事情。我们所在的社会有一套极其严密的“情绪模板”：葬礼上该流泪，求婚时该狂喜，升迁时该志得意满。默尔索的罪名，本质上不是他开了那五枪，而是他切断了身体与这些社会情绪之间的联动。他只对海水、阳光、性交和香烟有反应，而对“意义”过敏。

书中最关键的那场谋杀，我反复读了好几遍。

在阿尔及尔的海滩上，加缪把阳光写得像是一把利刃。默尔索开枪，不是出于仇恨，甚至不是出于自卫，那仅仅是一次感官过载后的生理崩溃。阳光太晃眼了，汗水流进了眼睛，在那一刻，世界失去了逻辑，只剩下一种无法排遣的焦灼。

这恰恰是全书最让人不安的地方。我们习惯于给所有的恶行找一个动机————为了钱，或者为了爱。有了动机，社会就觉得这个世界还在掌控之中。

但默尔索给出的答案是“因为阳光”。这个答案太荒诞了，它揭示了一个令人胆寒的真相：**人类所谓的文明和秩序，在偶然的生理冲动面前，脆弱得不堪一击**。

后半段的审判，默尔索彻底变成了一个旁观者，一个真正的“局外人”。

法官、检察官、甚至他自己的律师，他们在那场华丽的辞藻辩论中，拼命地想要给默尔索的行为缝合上一套合理的逻辑。他们揪着他在葬礼上没哭、喝了咖啡、抽了烟这些细节不放，强行把他塑造成一个丧心病狂的恶魔。

这种围猎感在现实中随处可见。我们无法容忍一个人的行为是没有逻辑的。如果一个杀人犯没有动机，那意味着我们每个人都有可能在某个瞬间变成杀人犯，或者无端地死于非命。为了维持“世界是有序的”这一幻觉，社会必须杀掉默尔索。

**他必须死，因为他证明了人生的无序**。

默尔索在临刑前拒绝了神父。那一刻的爆发，是我全书最心潮澎湃的时刻。

他意识到这个世界对他如此相像，也如此冷漠。这种冷漠不是一种敌意，而是一种坦然。既然星星和大地并不在意他的生死，那他也就不再需要对任何人的道德期待负责。

在这个被各种“正确”和“必选项”填满的时代，默尔索这种近乎自毁的坦率，反倒像是一剂清醒剂。他没有试图拯救谁，他只是拒绝在死前最后一次撒谎。

我们每个人都在小心翼翼地维持着某种“合群”的姿态，计算着每一句话的得体程度。而默尔索像是一面不带任何滤镜的镜子，照出了我们身上那些为了生存而不得不进行的、日复一日的表演。

**在这个冷漠的世界里，你并不欠任何人一个解释**。

[EN_START]

The incessant rain in Nanjing these past few days brings a chill that seems to seep into one’s very bones. Walking down Zhongshan Road, the view is filled with the desolation of withered plane trees. Lead-grey clouds hang low in the air—a gloom that inevitably reminds me of that piercing, viscous sunshine in Algiers that eventually brewed a murder.

I have just finished reading Camus’s The Stranger. It is a peculiar sensation; the book is not thick, yet it feels like a piece of sharply ground ice, quietly piercing through the warm illusions of daily life.

The most common label for this work is, of course, "the absurd." But as I closed the book, the phrase that lingered in my mind was: physiological truth.

People are accustomed to interpreting Meursault as a hero defying social conventions, but I prefer to see him as an "inner animal"—one who is intensely honest and refuses to "evolve."

He did not intentionally act cold at his mother’s funeral. To him, the long vigil, the blinding sun, and the scorching asphalt under his feet were physiological discomforts far more real than the abstract emotion of "maternal grief." He did not perform sorrow because, at that moment, his body truly felt nothing but exhaustion.

This is, in fact, quite offensive. Our society operates on a strictly defined "emotional template": one must weep at funerals, be ecstatic at proposals, and be filled with ambition upon promotion. Meursault’s "crime," in essence, was not the five shots he fired, but his severing of the link between his body and these socialized emotions. He reacted only to the sea, the sun, sex, and cigarettes; he was allergic to "meaning."

I reread the pivotal murder scene several times.

On that beach in Algiers, Camus writes of the sun as if it were a blade. Meursault’s shots were not born of hatred, nor even self-defense; they were merely a physiological collapse following a sensory overload. The sun was too dazzling, sweat stung his eyes—in that moment, the world lost its logic, leaving only an unshakeable agitation.

This is precisely the most unsettling part of the book. We are used to assigning a motive to every evil act—be it greed or love. With a motive, society feels the world remains under control.

But Meursault’s answer was "because of the sun." This answer is so absurd that it reveals a chilling truth: **human civilization and order are fragile beyond measure when faced with an accidental physiological impulse**.

In the trial of the second half, Meursault becomes a complete spectator—a true "outsider."

The judges, the prosecutors, and even his own lawyer, in their grandiloquent debates, desperately try to stitch a rational logic onto Meursault’s actions. They fixate on his lack of tears at the funeral, his coffee, and his cigarettes, forcibly sculpting him into a cold-blooded monster.

This sense of "predatory hunting" is omnipresent in reality. We cannot tolerate a person whose actions lack logic. If a murderer has no motive, it means any of us could become a killer—or die pointlessly—at any given moment. To maintain the illusion that "the world is orderly," society must kill Meursault.

**He had to die because he proved the disorder of life**.

Meursault’s refusal of the chaplain before his execution was the most pulse-pounding moment of the book for me.

He realized that the world was so much like him, and so indifferent. This indifference was not hostility, but a serene acceptance. Since the stars and the earth did not care for his life or death, he no longer needed to be responsible for anyone’s moral expectations.

In an era filled with "correctness" and "mandatory choices," Meursault’s almost self-destructive frankness acts as a sobering agent. He did not try to save anyone; he simply refused to tell one last lie before he died.

Every one of us is carefully maintaining a "conformist" posture, calculating the propriety of every word. Meursault acts as a lens without a filter, reflecting the daily performances we must endure just to survive.

**In this indifferent world, you owe no one an explanation**.

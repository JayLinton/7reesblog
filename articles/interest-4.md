去日本之前没告诉任何人。

4月25日递交了辞呈，当晚就下单了日本的旅游签，可惜后面撞上了劳动节，领事馆不上班，足足等到5月13日才下签。

不过反正也是头脑一热的冲动，没有规划行程和时间，这也是一个人旅行的好处。

买的国泰航空的航班（不得不说国泰的餐食甩了国内航司两条街），飞机从杭州中转香港飞抵东京羽田。

落地时夜幕已沉，在飞驰的山手线电车上，我看着窗外流动的东京夜色，心里升起一种久违的兴奋——那是即将窥见又一座异国城市的雀跃。  

酒店定在了东新宿——是的，就是那个大名鼎鼎的歌舞伎町一番街所在的东新宿，入住第一天便碰上了超级drama的事件。

落地就已经很晚，抵达酒店收拾停当，到直到快2点钟才睡下。睡了不到半小时，迷迷糊糊听到了有警报声和广播声，起初没有太在意（因为实在太困了），停了一会广播声和警报声再次响起，声音大到我没办法做到继续死睡。

我几乎不懂日语，好死不死这广播只说日语。只好拿出手机翻译器录了一段，看到翻译出来的结果差点没给我吓死。

“发生了二次火灾，请冷静避难。”

心脏骤停。

我慌忙套上衣服推门探查，走廊里已经站了不少人。  

隔壁一对情侣率先发问，Are you smoking in room？

No，我回答。

接着对面房间也加入到了讨论，一致决定拿着东西赶紧跑路。

有趣的是，直到我们顺着紧急通道跑到地面，聚在一起交流时才发现，原来大家都是中国人。四个中国人在日本街头，用英语煞有介事地对话了半天，场面滑稽得有些荒诞。

我们在凌晨的东京街头等来了消防车。几个消防员进楼排查一番后，大家才获准回房。后来了解了一下，原来日本的消防法规极其严苛，浴室蒸汽或者烟味都极易触发那套敏感的报警系统。

好在是虚惊一场。

刚落地还发了个朋友圈“开始了，小x的奇妙冒险”，这下真是冒上险了。

[EN_START]

I didn't tell a soul before heading to Japan.

I handed in my resignation on April 25th and applied for my tourist visa that very night. Unfortunately, Labor Day got in the way, and with the consulate closed for the holiday, I had to wait until May 13th for the visa to be issued.

But then again, it was a spur-of-the-moment decision. No itinerary, no schedule—that’s the beauty of solo travel.

I flew with Cathay Pacific (I must say, their meals are leagues ahead of domestic airlines), transiting through Hong Kong from Hangzhou to Tokyo Haneda. By the time I landed, night had already fallen. As the Yamanote Line sped through the city, I watched the flowing lights of Tokyo through the window, feeling a long-lost thrill—the sheer excitement of catching my first glimpse of a foreign metropolis.

My hotel was in Higashi-Shinjuku—yes, right by the infamous Kabukicho Ichibangai. On my very first night, I ran into some major drama.

I arrived late and didn't hit the hay until nearly 2:00 AM. Less than half an hour later, I was stirred by the sound of sirens and announcements. I ignored them at first (I was exhausted), but they persisted, getting so loud that it was impossible to sleep through.

I know almost zero Japanese, and as luck would have it, the announcements were Japanese-only. I had to record a snippet for a translator app. The result nearly scared the life out of me:

"A secondary fire has occurred. Please evacuate calmly."

My heart skipped a beat.

I scrambled into my clothes and pushed open the door to investigate. The hallway was already filled with people. A couple next door asked me immediately, "Are you smoking in your room?"

"No," I replied.

A guest from the opposite room joined the fray, and we all decided to grab our belongings and bolt.

The funny thing is, it wasn't until we ran down the emergency exit to the street and started talking that we realized—we were all Chinese. There we were, four Chinese people on a Japanese street, speaking solemn English to each other for ages. It was a moment as comical as it was absurd.

We waited for the fire trucks on the streets of Tokyo in the early hours. After a few firefighters inspected the building, we were finally allowed back in. I later learned that Japanese fire regulations are incredibly strict—even steam from a shower or a hint of cigarette smoke can easily trigger their hyper-sensitive alarm systems.

Thankfully, it was a false alarm.

I had just posted on WeChat: "And so begins my bizarre adventure." Well, I certainly got the "adventure" I asked for.

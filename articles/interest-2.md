今年TGA颁奖礼看下来，我严重怀疑评委们的鼠标是不是粘了502——点来点开都是《光与影：33号远征队》，这哪是颁奖，分明是给法国佬办了场荣誉批发大会。

29个奖项狂揽9个，从年度游戏到最佳叙事，从最佳RPG到最佳独立游戏，连领奖BGM都快循环成洗脑神曲，建议下次直接改叫33号远征队专属表彰大会，省得其他提名游戏白跑一趟。
 
最心疼的当属《天国：拯救2》，明明带着中世纪开放世界的诚意而来，剧情量堪比多部电影串连，玩法上把沉浸式体验拉满，结果全程坐冷板凳，提名拿了不少，奖项颗粒无收。官方赛后发梗图调侃责怪法国人，还附文GGWP，这波自嘲简直把玩家的委屈值拉满——就像精心准备了满汉全席，结果评委们只盯着隔壁桌的法式甜点猛炫，连尝一口的机会都不给。

更离谱的是33号远征军那含金量存疑的独立游戏奖项。要知道这游戏开发高峰虽只有30来人，背后却藏着数百名外包，这独立性堪比穿貂皮大衣的流浪汉，硬是凭着组委会的偏爱，把最佳独立游戏和最佳独立处女作打包带走。

反观《天国：拯救2》，老老实实地做着传统RPG该有的样子，剧情有张力、世界有厚度，偏偏不符合评委们的文艺审美，只能看着别人鸠占鹊巢。
 
整场颁奖礼最精彩的不是获奖感言，而是台下的众生相：62岁的小岛秀夫坐如喽啰，被同一游戏反复碾压到气笑，表情管理堪比去年黑猴美术总监，两人简直能组个“TGA意难平”情头。

而《天国：拯救2》的制作组大概在台下忙着算机票钱，毕竟来一趟除了混个脸熟，啥也没捞着，堪称年度最亏差旅费支出。
 
平心而论，33号远征军的美术和音乐确实有亮点，但也不至于把所有重量级奖项全包圆吧？就像食堂阿姨打饭，给一个人盛满了整锅菜，其他人只能看着空盘子发呆。TGA这波操作，成功让游戏奥斯卡变成了游戏偏心奖，建议明年直接把所有奖项刻好名字寄给33号团队，省得办直播浪费电。
 
最后只能心疼《天国：拯救2》三秒钟，下次评奖前，要不先学学法式浪漫营销，再给评委们包个远征队周边大礼包？毕竟在今年的TGA舞台上，实力或许重要，但“评委缘”这东西，看来比中世纪的屠龙宝刀还稀有。

[EN_START]

After watching this year’s The Game Awards, I seriously suspect the judges’ mice were glued shut with super glue—no matter which category they clicked on, the winner was always *Light and Shadow: Expedition 33*. This wasn’t an awards ceremony; it was basically an honor wholesale event tailor-made for the French dev team.

Claiming 9 out of 29 awards, it swept everything from Game of the Year and Best Narrative to Best RPG and Best Independent Game. The acceptance speech BGM looped so many times it’s practically a brainwashing earworm. Next time, TGA might as well rebrand itself as the *33rd Expedition Exclusive Commendation Gala*—saves all the other nominated games the trouble of showing up for nothing.

The real heartbreak goes to *Kingdom Come: Deliverance II*. It came in with genuine passion for medieval open-world design, boasting a story that’s as sprawling as a marathon of epic films and gameplay that cranks immersion up to 11. Yet it spent the entire night on the metaphorical bench—racking up nominations left and right but going home empty-handed. After the show, the official team posted a meme jokingly blaming the French devs, captioning it “GGWP.” This self-deprecating move perfectly bottled the players’ frustration—it’s like spending weeks crafting a lavish feast, only to watch the judges fixate on a plate of French pastries from the next table, refusing to even take a single bite of your spread.

Even more absurd is *Expedition 33*’s highly questionable win for Best Independent Game. Sure, its core development team peaked at just 30 people—but behind the scenes, hundreds of outsourced workers were involved. That’s about as “independent” as a homeless guy wearing a full-length mink coat. Yet thanks to the organizers’ blatant favoritism, it walked away with both Best Independent Game and Best Debut Indie Game in one fell swoop.

Compare that to *Kingdom Come: Deliverance II*. It stuck to the classic RPG playbook with sincerity—delivering a gripping story and a rich, layered open world. But it just didn’t fit the judges’ artsy aesthetic, leaving it to watch someone else steal the spotlight that rightfully belonged to it.

The real highlight of the entire show wasn’t the acceptance speeches—it was the facial expressions of the audience in the crowd: Hideo Kojima, 62 years old, sat there like a nobody, getting repeatedly crushed by the same game until he had to laugh it off. His masterful poker face was on par with the art director of *Black Myth: Wukong* from last year. These two could totally make a “TGA Heartbreak” meme couple profile picture.

As for the *Kingdom Come 2* dev team? They were probably busy calculating their travel expenses—after all, the only thing they got out of this trip was a moment of fame, with zero awards to show for it. This has got to be the most wasteful travel expense of the year.

To be fair, *Expedition 33* does shine when it comes to art and music—but that’s no excuse to hoard every major award like a kid hogging the entire candy jar. It’s like the cafeteria lady serving one student the whole pot of food, leaving everyone else staring at empty plates. With this move, TGA successfully turned the “Oscars of Gaming” into the “Gaming Favoritism Awards.” Next year, they might as well just engrave the winners’ names on the trophies in advance and mail them directly to the *Expedition 33* team—saves the hassle and electricity bill of hosting a live show.

Final thought: Let’s spare three seconds of sympathy for *Kingdom Come: Deliverance II*. Maybe next time before submitting for awards, they should learn a thing or two about French-style romantic marketing—and throw in a goodie bag of *Expedition 33* merch for the judges. After all, on this year’s TGA stage, talent may matter—but “judge appeal” is proving to be rarer than a dragon-slaying sword in the medieval era.

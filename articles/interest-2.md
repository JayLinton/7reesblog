说真的，看完今年的颁奖礼，我唯一的感想就是建议 TGA 明年原地解散。

以前我觉得 TGA 是“游戏界的奥斯卡”，现在看它更像是《33远征军》的庆功年会。真的，干脆别叫The Game Awards了，改名叫The 33rd Expedition Awards算了。看这架势，我都怀疑评委席是不是全被远征军给编排了，从年度游戏到最佳叙事，从最佳RPG到最佳独立游戏，大奖小奖一锅端，不知道的还以为今年全世界就出了这一款游戏，别的游戏连口汤都没喝上。
 
最心疼的还是小岛秀夫，这大哥每年准时报到，西装笔挺地坐在台下，被同一游戏反复碾压到气笑。TGA缺流量了就请小岛出来走两步，发个预告，搞个互动，等到了真正分蛋糕的时候，小岛手里的盘子比他的游戏剧本都空。下次直接给岛主搬个按摩椅坐台下吧，起码坐得舒服点。

还有《天国拯救 2》，战马工作室那群老哥辛辛苦苦在波希米亚搬了半天砖，把中世纪还原得连空气都透着那股味儿，结果跑来洛杉矶陪跑了一整晚，提名拿了不少，奖项颗粒无收，主打一个重在参与。这种硬核的浪漫在这一届评委眼里可能还不如远征军的一块勋章。看着这些真正有灵魂的作品在那儿白忙活，我甚至觉得台上的奖杯都在尴尬地发抖。
 
如果明年的 TGA 还是这种一人得道，全家白跑的画风，那真没必要办了。省下那点电费和场地费，让小岛秀夫多剪两个预告片，让战马工作室多修几个BUG，对玩家的心理健康可能贡献更大。

Honestly, after watching this year's ceremony, my only thought is that the TGA should just disband on the spot next year.

I used to think the TGA was the "Oscars of gaming," but now it looks more like a private victory party for The 33rd Expedition. Seriously, they might as well stop calling it "The Game Awards" and just rename it "The 33rd Expedition Awards." Looking at this mess, I’m starting to wonder if the judging panel was entirely staffed by the Expedition team. From GOTY to Best Narrative, Best RPG to Best Indie—they swept everything. If you didn’t know better, you’d think this was the only game released in the entire world this year. Everyone else didn't even get a sip of the leftover soup.

The one I feel for the most is Hideo Kojima. The man shows up on time every year, sitting there in his sharp suit, only to be repeatedly steamrolled by the same game until he’s laughing just to keep from crying. When TGA needs traffic, they drag Kojima out to walk the stage, drop a trailer, and do some "interaction." But when it’s time to actually cut the cake, Kojima’s plate is emptier than one of his own game scripts. Next time, just bring a massage chair to the front row for him; at least he’d be comfortable while getting snubbed.

Then there’s Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. The folks at Warhorse Studios spent years "laying bricks" in Bohemia, recreating the Middle Ages so vividly you can practically smell the air—only to spend the whole night in L.A. as glorified seat-warmers. They racked up plenty of nominations but went home empty-handed; a classic case of "it’s the taking part that counts." Apparently, that kind of hardcore romance is worth less than a single medal from the Expedition in the eyes of this year’s judges. Watching these soulful masterpieces go home with nothing makes me feel like even the trophies on stage are shaking with embarrassment.

If next year's TGA is going to keep up this "winner takes all, everyone else walks" vibe, there’s really no point in holding it. Save the electricity and the venue fees. Let Kojima edit two more trailers and let Warhorse fix a few more bugs—that would be a much bigger contribution to the mental health of gamers everywhere.

原本计划在2025年尾跟风写点年终总结之类的东西。

打开Notion，写写删删、删删改改，最终还是没能写出让自己满意的文字。本来是个记忆力差劲、三分钟热度的人，让我一下子总结一年发生的事情，实在是笔力不足。

那最终的决定是借用各平台的年度数据，来总结一下2025年的赛博起居注。**所以这是一篇完全没有任何语言斟酌、没有任何营养、没有任何意义、纯粹自娱自乐的流水账口水文！**

2025年最大的改变是从杭州搬到了南京，是我大学时期的dream land。虽然真生活在这里有点幻灭而且其实有点想杭州这事另说，至少现在的工作更加轻松，人也变得更松弛了。不过年龄增长的同时好像越来越惜命了，吃了很多补品，什么Swisse的维C和复合维生素、goodhealth的牡蛎精华，难说有没有用，聊以安慰吧。

### **足迹**：

今年海外去了日本的东京和韩国的济州两个城市，都是独行。虽然我既不会日语（看动漫学的三脚猫日语不算）也不会韩语，甚至英语也是勉强够用的程度，但还是玩的蛮开心，果然旅行才是人生的终极意义吧！

### **游戏：**

今年玩的最开心的游戏应该是《三角洲行动》和《战地6》。

不过三角洲行动很早就AFK了，已经感受不到刚开始的乐趣——不知道是不是因为自己本身电子ED的原因——身边的朋友也相继退坑，甚至约不到人玩。

> Lumi：不许打三角洲了，陪我玩！

倒是《战地6》让我越玩越开心，身为战地老粉，虽然每一代都是在被当薯条狂捞的路上，但是这一代还是给了我很大的惊喜。DICE好像真的会听玩家说话了，削减了大地图的数量，新增的试炼场模式相当惊艳，DICE念念不忘的大逃杀好像也真的不错，不过不建议绑定每周任务哈，实在不想做大逃杀任务（其实是根本打不死人），还有把你那反人类的UI和逆天bug改改你就是我心目中年度最佳。

今年还线下看了守望先锋杭州Major总决赛，见证了CR夺冠。CNOW差强人意的成绩和半死不活的环境姑且就不再提了，聊聊单机。

今年第一次通关了美末1，受到相当大的震撼，边玩边求证这居然是2013年的游戏！我知道这个IP一直很出名，但我一直一直没玩过也没云过，顽皮狗你宣发还不够啊！

《天国：拯救2》也是今年玩过最有趣的游戏，剧情演出、游戏玩法都很出色，唯一的不足可能是我的不足，这用鼠标滑动来控制攻击方向的战斗方式让我十分费解和十分不适，最终使我弃坑。

《江山北望》这部影游也给了很大惊喜。其实我还蛮喜欢影游，第一部玩的应该是影游市场还没有像现在这么热火朝天时期的《隐形守护者》，这部《江山北望》也是前者的新作。剧情可圈可点，但是肉眼可见的贫穷，跟隔壁算是师出同门的《盛世天下》（这部是云的）的精致相比，可以说是被吊打的程度。期待下一部《绍宋》能够制作精良一点吧。

### **影视：**

今年电影看了《名侦探柯南：迷宫的十字路口》、《八佰》、《穿越时空的少女》、《哪吒之魔童闹海》、《唐探1900》、《绿皮书》、《黑客帝国》、《花样年华》、《机动战士高达：跨时之战》、《猎金游戏》、《一代宗师》、《碟中谍8：最终清算》、《奥本海默》、《F1：狂飙飞车》、《1917》、《鬼灭之刃：无限城篇 第一章 猗窝座再袭》、《疯狂动物城2》。其中个人认为观影体验最好的是《F1：狂飙飞车》、《花样年华》和《疯狂动物城2》，最烂的是哪吒，哪吒我还被迫看了两遍，……。值得一提的是，《奥本海默》是我在飞往东京的航班上看的，坐在前排的一个日本哥们也在看，哈哈。

电视剧看了《未知的首尔》、《重启人生》和《东京爱情故事》，《重启人生》真真好评。

后面应该会单独写几篇影评，大概吧……

### **阅读：**

读书越来越趋向于电子阅读了，虽然今年买了好几本新书，结果确实实体书在书架落灰，真正看的还是微信读书里的电子版本，曾几何时我还很不提倡电子阅读来着……

今年读完了《长安的荔枝》、《太白金星有点烦》、《局外人》、《龙与少年游》、《撒哈拉的故事》、《解忧杂货店》、《地狱变》，今年才开始读的有《长日将尽》、《留德十年》、《红楼梦》。红楼梦算是重读，上一次看还是初三，还真是常看常新。今年的诺奖得主克拉斯诺霍尔卡伊·拉斯洛的代表作《撒旦探戈》，翻了几页感觉好难读，不知道是不是翻译的问题。感想是诺奖不愧是诺奖，还有感想是去年韩江那种浅滩文学到底是怎么夺奖的……

哦对了，2025年《百年孤独》的阅读进度是3%（扶额笑）。

在写这篇总结的时候，我边查着豆瓣的影音记录，边震惊于这电影竟然是今年看的，竟然是今年才上映的，啊不是去年吗。

2025年就是这么感觉过得又快又慢的一年，庸庸碌碌浪费了人生的又一个365天。希望这次博客运行的能够长久一点，兴许明年还能再乱写个年终总结？算了还是不要再立flag了，总结大概率是不会有了，还是祈祷小破站能够活得久一点吧。

眼看今天27号将要结束，距离2026年不过4天而已。提前祝大家2026新年快乐，还请收下这干涩贫瘠的祝福。

所以，2025，要不先别走？

[EN_START]

I had originally planned to follow the trend and write some sort of year-end summary at the end of 2025.

I opened Notion, wrote and deleted, deleted and revised, but in the end, I still couldn't produce anything I was satisfied with. I'm a person with a bad memory and a short attention span to begin with; asking me to summarize a whole year's worth of events all at once is just beyond my writing ability.

So, the final decision was to borrow from the annual data of various platforms to piece together a "cyber-journal" for 2025. **So this is a rambling, stream-of-consciousness post, completely devoid of linguistic deliberation, nutritional value, or any meaning whatsoever, purely for my own entertainment!**

The biggest change in 2025 was moving from Hangzhou to Nanjing, my "dream land" from my university days. Although real life here has been a bit disillusioning and I actually miss Hangzhou a little (that's another story), at least my current job is more relaxed, and I've become a more relaxed person. However, as I get older, I seem to cherish my life more and more. I've been taking a lot of supplements, like Swisse Vitamin C and multivitamins, and Goodhealth's oyster extract. It's hard to say if they're useful, but I guess it's for peace of mind.

**Travels:**

This year, I went abroad to two cities, Tokyo in Japan and Jeju in South Korea, both solo trips. Although I don't speak Japanese (the three-legged-cat Japanese I picked up from anime doesn't count) or Korean, and my English is barely passable, I still had a great time. I guess travel really is the ultimate meaning of life!

**Gaming:**

The games I had the most fun with this year were probably *Delta Force* and *Battlefield 6*.

However, I went AFK from Delta Force very early on and can no longer feel the initial fun—I don't know if it's because of my own "electronic ED" or what—but my friends also quit one after another, to the point where I can't even find anyone to play with.

> Lumi: Stop playing Delta Force and play with me!

On the other hand, *Battlefield 6* has been making me happier and happier as I play. As a veteran Battlefield fan, even though I get farmed like a noob in every installment, this one has still given me a huge surprise. It seems like DICE is actually listening to players now. They've reduced the number of large maps, the new Proving Grounds mode is stunning, and the battle royale mode that DICE has been obsessed with seems to be pretty good too. However, I suggest not tying it to weekly missions; I really don't want to do battle royale missions (actually, it's because I can't kill anyone). Also, if you could just fix that anti-human UI and those insane bugs, you'd be my game of the year.

I also attended the Overwatch Hangzhou Major Finals offline this year, witnessing CR win the crown. As for the disappointing results and the lifeless environment of CNOW, let's move on and talk about single-player games.

![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/27/a2E1JI8SmZ5YTcN.webp)

This year, I finished *The Last of Us Part I* for the first time and was absolutely shocked. While playing, I had to keep confirming that this was actually a 2013 game! I know this IP has always been famous, but I had never played or even watched a playthrough of it. Naughty Dog, your marketing wasn't good enough!

![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/27/sFyaKOUR9fL6jSw.webp)

*Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2* was also one of the most interesting games I played this year. The story, acting, and gameplay were all excellent. The only drawback was probably my own inadequacy; the combat style of using mouse swipes to control attack direction was extremely baffling and uncomfortable for me, which eventually led me to quit.

The FMV game *Jiangshan Bei Wang* was also a big surprise. I actually quite like FMV games; the first one I played was probably *The Invisible Guardian*, from a time when the FMV game market wasn't as hot as it is now. *Jiangshan Bei Wang* is a new work from the same team. The plot is commendable, but the poverty of the production is visible to the naked eye. Compared to the exquisite production of *Shengshi Tianxia* (which I only watched online), which could be considered from a sibling studio, it's a complete blowout. I hope their next work, *Shao Song*, can be better produced.

**Movies & TV:**

This year, I watched the movies *Detective Conan: Crossroad in the Ancient Capital*, *The Eight Hundred*, *The Girl Who Leapt Through Time*, *Nezha 2*, *Detective Chinatown 1900*, *Green Book*, *The Matrix*, *In the Mood for Love*, *Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX, *A Gilded Game* , *The Grandmaster*, *Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two*, *Oppenheimer*, *F1: The Movie, *1917*, *Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie : Infinity Castle*, and *Zootopia 2*. Personally, I think the best viewing experiences were *F1: The Movie*, *In the Mood for Love*, and *Zootopia 2*. The worst was *Nezha*, and I was forced to watch *Nezha* twice... On a side note, I watched *Oppenheimer* on the flight to Tokyo, and a Japanese guy sitting in front of me was also watching it, haha.

![img](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/27/tL62o7gSNYVruAK.webp)

For TV series, I watched *Our Unwritten Seoul*, *Rebooting* (likely *Brush Up Life*), and *Tokyo Love Story*.

I'll probably write a few separate film reviews later... probably...

**Reading:**

My reading is leaning more and more towards e-books. Although I bought several new physical books this year, they ended up gathering dust on the shelf. The ones I actually read were the electronic versions on WeRead. To think there was a time I was strongly against e-reading...

This year, I finished *The Litchi Road*, *Lord Taibai's Minor Annoyance*, *The Stranger*, *Dragon and the Young Man*, *The Stories of the Sahara*, *Miracles of the Namiya General Store*, and *Hell Screen*. The books I started this year are *The Remains of the Day*, *Ten Years in Germany*, and *Dream of the Red Chamber*. *Dream of the Red Chamber* is a reread; the last time I read it was in junior high, and it's true that you discover new things with each reading. The representative work of this year's Nobel laureate, László Krasznahorkai, *Satantango*, felt very difficult to read after just a few pages. I don't know if it's the translation's fault. My thoughts are that the Nobel Prize is worthy of its name, but also, how did shallow literature like Han Kang's from last year even win...

Oh, right, my 2025 reading progress for *One Hundred Years of Solitude* is 3% (facepalm).

As I'm writing this summary, I'm checking my records on Douban and am shocked to find out that "I actually watched this movie this year?" "It was actually released this year? Huh, not last year?"

2025 has been a year that felt both fast and slow, another 365 days aimlessly wasted. I hope this blog can run for a longer time. Maybe I can randomly write another year-end summary next year? Nah, better not jinx it. The summary probably won't happen. I'd rather just pray that this humble little site can survive for a long time.

Seeing as the 27th is about to end, there are only 4 days left until 2026. I wish you all a happy New Year 2026 in advance, and please accept this dry and barren blessing.

So, 2025, maybe... don't leave just yet?
